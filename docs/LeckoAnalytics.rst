Prerequisites
=============

To benefit from all the previously cited functionalities, you need to
satisfy some prerequisites on both the business and technical side.

**Business prerequisites**

eXo Engagement Analytics by Lecko is a partnered add-on with `Lecko Analytics <http://analytics.lecko.fr/>`__. 
It is available only with the **commercial editions of eXo Platform** 
and requires the purchase of a dedicated add-on subscription from eXo 
Platform. Please refer to `Appendix 4 of the Master Subscription Agreement <https://www.exoplatform.com/terms-conditions/terms-conditions.pdf>`__.

**Technical prerequisites**

Having satisfied the business prerequisites, you should also cater for
the technical side:

-  Install the add-on in your eXo Platform. Check the next section for 
   more details about the installation phase.

-  Have network access to upload data collected from eXo Platform into 
   `Lecko Analytics <http://analytics.lecko.fr/>`__ Cloud Platform.

   This has to be factored with your internal security constraints.
   eXo Platform uses a secured FTP endpoint to communicate with Lecko's 
   Cloud Platform.

-  Have a network web access with :ref:`SSL enabled <Security.HTTPSConf>` 
   to reach Lecko Analytics portal.

.. _eXoAddonsGuide.LeckoAnalytics.howWorks:

=================
How does it work?
=================

While starting the platform and having eXo Engagement Analytics add-on
installed, a job is launched to make the export.

The export ends when all needed information are exported or when the end
time defined in
:ref:`exo.properties <Configuration.ConfigurationOverview>` expires.

In case of restarting the platform, the job resumes its work from the
point when it stopped in the last time. In fact, the lecko service job
marks every exported element: space stream or user stream.

When the export is fully done, the service will send the report file to
the configured FTP in :ref:`exo.properties <Configuration.ConfigurationOverview>`.

After successful sending of the export file, eXo Engagement Analytics
add-on service restarts its progression to delete the export file and
then stops. In the next occurence, it will start a fresh export.

**Monitoring**

It is also possible to monitor eXo Engagement Analytics add-on via
JConsole as some Mbeans are available:

-  **buildLeckoData**: This action will start the data export even if
   ``exo.addons.lecko.job.enabled`` parameter is set to false in
   :ref:`exo.properties <Configuration.ConfigurationOverview>`.

   It does nothing if the export is running.

-  **stopLeckoExport**: If the exoprt is running, it will stop it.

-  **UploadLeckoData**: If the export is finished, it will upload the
   dump file to lecko's ftp. It does nothins if the service is running.

-  **enableLeckoJob**: It is a string Mbean parameter with which you can
   set ``exo.addons.lecko.job.enabled`` to true or false.

-  **getEnableLeckoJob**: It informs if jobs are activated or not.

-  **getJobStatus**: It displays information about lecko analytics jobs:
   the exopt folder, its status (running or not) and the completion
   percentage.

-  **resetExtraction**: It helps to start fresh export: it removes the
   dump file without sending it and cleans the database.
